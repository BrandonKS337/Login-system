User login setup for allowing user usage on a react xpress app


steps
- created repo and cloned it to pull .gitignore and readme as well as set upstream. 
- npx create-react-app <name>
- installed mobx and mobx-react 
    - added both with --save to the pkg.json 
- modified the app.js to base template. This sets our app as a class and applies react.component? after that we set t to render and return html

            import React from "react";
            import "./App.css";

            class App extends React.Component {
                render() {
                    return (
                    <>
                        <div className="app">ald;kgh</div>
                    </>
                    );
                }
            }

            export default App;
